Changing content
The content of this project is defined in four .mdx files inside the theme's sections folder. You can override the files intro.mdx, projects.mdx, about.mdx and contact.mdx. This starter has overridden all files for you already.

You have to use the <ProjectCard /> component inside projects.mdx to display the cards. Example:

## Projects

<ProjectCard title="Freiheit" link="https://www.behance.net/gallery/58937147/Freiheit" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #D4145A 0%, #FBB03B 100%)">
This project is my entry to Adobe's #ChallengeYourPerspective contest.
</ProjectCard>
Change your static folder
The static folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too! You can use Real Favicon Generator to generate the image files inside static.
